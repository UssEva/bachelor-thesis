\section{Examples}

\paragraph{Example Bug.}
Some of the detected actual bugs are shown in Figure \ref{fig:bugs}.
\paragraph{False Positive.}
In Figure \ref{fig:false_positives} there are some token sequences that were falsely reported as bugs but are false positives.
\paragraph{Refactoring Opportunity.}
When you analyse the blocks in Figure \ref{fig:refactoring}, you notice the refactoring opportunities that could make the code more easy to read and understand. But the actual functionality of these code blocks is working just fine and does not need to be fixed.
